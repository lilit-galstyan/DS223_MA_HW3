DS223 - Marketing Analytics, Homework 3 on Survival Analysis

Welcome to the customer survival analysis repository! 
In this homework, I have delved into the telco data, employing Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) parametric models with various distributions to identify significant factors influencing customer churn. Through the comparisons of the models with four different distributions - Exponential, Weibull, Log-Normal and Loglogistic, I pinpointed the Log-Normal AFT model as the decision-maker, based on the better AIC score as the comparison metric. Leveraging crucial features such as tenure, age, marital status, and service categories, I aim to provide actionable insights for customer churn. 
In addition, I have calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) per customer based on the final AFT model and explored CLV variations within distinct customer segments. 
These findings lay the groundwork for targeted retention strategies, offering a comprehensive approach to enhance customer loyalty and maximize business value. Feel free to explore the code and analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the methodology and insights.
